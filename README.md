# No Apologies Playlist

We spend a lot of time passing a phone around a room to queue up music.  This project aims to solve for that by allowing users to connect to a single session (think jackboxTV) and submit songs to a shared Spotify queue/playlist.  

## Getting Started

At this stage the project is just some Node/Express template for setting up basic client -> server auth using JWT and secure cookies.  Next step is building out the Oauth2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow for Spotify.  

### Prerequisites

Node 12.13.0 is the basis of this project.  

Create a Spotify Account and set up your project at [Spotify Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com)

You'll need to generate a Client ID and Client Secret.  Make sure to save them in your .ENV and don't commit them to your repo. 




### Installing

`npm install` for starters.

Check out the `package.json` for the standard build scripts and run environments.
